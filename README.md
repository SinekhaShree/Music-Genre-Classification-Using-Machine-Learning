Music Genre Classification Project

Overview

This project aims to classify music genres based on audio features extracted from music samples using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains a comprehensive collection of audio features across multiple genres, including statistical properties, spectral characteristics, and rhythm patterns.

Features

Dataset: The dataset comprises audio features extracted from music samples spanning various genres, ensuring a diverse and representative sample for classification.

Algorithms: The project employs a range of machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost, to classify music genres based on the extracted audio features.

Evaluation: Performance evaluation is conducted using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the effectiveness of each classification model.

Usage

Dataset Preparation: Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and located in the data directory.

Configuration: Adjust hyperparameters and model configurations as needed in the config.py file.

Execution: Run the main script to initiate the training and evaluation process for the classification models.

Results

Detailed performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are provided in the project report.
